                    <p><strong>Théo de Blic redeems himself and wins AcroMax in front of championship leader Luke De Weert. Meanwhile Florian Landreau and Gabi Fonck take their 2nd win in a row in the Acro World Qualifier.</strong></p>
                    <p>With weather conditions rarely seen in that event, AcroMax proved to be an incredible success once again. With all competitions running flawlessly and giving a show rarely seen before, the italian stop of the Acro World Tour proved to be one of the highlight of the season.</p>
                    <p><strong>Théo de Blic (FRA) wins AcroMax with a clean sweep</strong></p>
                    <p>After a disappointing 4th place in the last AWT event (Kings of the Box) the frenchman was definitely on a quest to remind the acro world that he was still a contender for the Acro World Tour title. He put in a stunning performance winning all 3 runs of this year’s AcroMax, even scoring the highest run score of the season so far to grab his second season’s victory.</p>
                    <p><strong>Luke De Weert still tops the Acro World Tour leaderboard but the gap is shrinking.</strong></p>
                    <p>After his maiden win back in June, the dutchman was hungry for more in AcroMax and despite not grabbing the win he was definitely not giving up without a fight, scoring 2nd place on each runs and not giving up any points. At the end of the day he managed to hold on to that 1st place in the championship standings but the gap fell down by 0.8 points and he is now only 0.45p ahead of rival Théo de BLIC. Both pilots seem to be on a league of their own as they have an 8 points lead to the closest contender Axel Coste (FRA). It is clear that the next stop in the Acro World Tour, the Acro Show will be a critical point in the season.
                        Thanks to his second podium in a row Egor Posokhin managed to shrink the gap between him and Axel’s overall third place and will sure be trying to capitalize on these good results, promising an exciting end of season.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rookies steal the show</strong></p>    
                    <p>Vincent Tornare (CHE) managed his best performance of the season, finishing at a promising 6th place in front of well known veterans like Andres Villamizar and last year’s AWT 3rd place overall Meal Jimenez. The swissman managed to climb 8th in the championship standing and has now taken an almost definitive step to stay in the tour for 2024.
                        Meanwhile Italian Marco Papa has seen his hope for a good results end due to a counter performance in both run 1 and 3.</p>
                    <p><strong>Florian Landreau (FRA) makes it a back to back win in the AWQ!</strong></p>
                    <p>The frenchman made it two in a row in Italy after previously winning the opening stage in Switzerland. He definitely proved he stands head and shoulders above the rest of the pack this year winning once again with a lead of over 4 point in front of Jose Luis Garcia (COL). The podium was actually identical to the last AWQ in Brienz with the Swiss rookie Lucas Ruffieux taking 3rd place once again.
                        Overall Florian extends his lead to 8 points and set himself apart as one of the most promising prospect in years.</p>

                        <p><strong>Gabi Fonck wins once again the female category!</strong></p>
                    <p>Gabriela Fonck (GER) won once again in the female ranking showing an impressive performance and stomping incredibly clean and technical runs. Even more impressive Gabriela managed to once again finish 6th overall and climbed to the 5th place of the overall AWQ ranking! Meanwhile Daniela Freutsmiedl (GER) and Jennifer Ploschberger (AUT) respectively finished 2nd and 3rd with Daniela also grabbing a spot in the top 10 overall.</p>
                    <p><strong>The battle for the second golden ticket to the AWQ intensifies</strong></p>
                    <p>If Florian Landreau is almost sure of making it into the pro tour next year the second spot is still undecided. But the battle for that ticket seems to be between 2 pilots as Jose Garcia and Lucas Ruffieux are only 1 point apart from each other but managed to create a 1.5 point gap to their closest opponent the frenchman Hugo Lami and a 6 point gap to first female Gabi Fonck.</p>
                    <p><strong>Synchro is finally back!</strong></p>
                    <p>This event marked the grand opening of the Synchro World Tour and saw the team Back2Back (Luke De Weert&Théo de Blic) winning their first ever synchro event together. Despite being rival in the Acro World Tour the two friends managed to team up perfectly and won each tasks of the competition finishing in front of the Colombians from the U-Turn Acro Team (Cesar Arevalo & Andres Villamizar) and Team GayRmany (Siegfried Heinrich & Daniela Freutsmiedl). The Synchro World Tour will continue in next week’s event the Acro Show and will crown the Synchro World Tour Champions during the grand finale in Oludeniz end of September.</p>
