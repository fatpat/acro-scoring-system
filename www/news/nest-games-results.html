                        FIRST EVER ACRO WORLD TOUR EVENT OVER GROUND</h2>
                    <p><strong>The grand opening of the new « Over the ground format »</strong></p>
                    <p>On Saturday 10th of June the first ever Acro World Tour event over the ground took place in St
                        Hilaire du Touvet, France. This event called Nest Games was the opening stop of the 2023 season.
                        But it
                        was most of all the grand unveiling of the
                        brand new competition format allowing
                        competitions from the Pro tour to take
                        place above the ground after over 20
                        years of competition above water.</p>
                    <p>It is safe to say that the event was a great
                        success with the 3 runs flown within a
                        single day despite a challenging forecast.
                        The general level of the competition was
                        one of the highest ever seen in Acro
                        competition and yet everything was
                        done in perfect safety with pilots able to
                        push hard and yet stop high enough to
                        proceed for a safe landing. In the end it
                        was a great showcase of how safe and
                        how good the new « above the ground »
                        format is and will be for the future of acro
                        flying.</p>
                    <p><strong>Théo de Blic wins in front of Luke De Weert
                            by one of the tightest margin ever seen.</strong></p>
                    <p>Competition wise it was a hard fought
                        battle between Théo de Blic (FRA) and Luke
                        De Weert (NED) with the frenchman
                        coming in first by only 0,025 point out of 39
                        points which is one of the smallest
                        difference ever registered within the world
                        of acro flying. Théo and Luke were
                        respectively 2nd and 3rd after run 1 behind
                        Axel Coste flying the AirG Carlito who
                        pulled the first ever Full twisted Flat Stall to
                        Infinity. But the battle really started on run 2 with
                        Luke flying a Kooky from Sky Paragliders
                        gaining the first position scoring the
                        highest run of the competition and Théo
                        finishing 2nd of that run being set back
                        by 0,9points from the lead. The 3rd and
                        last run ended up being flown in tough
                        and changing conditions and both pilots
                        ended up with a really low altitude for
                        the final. In the end Théo flying his Nova
                        Paragliders Glitch managed to grab 1st
                        on that run being able to pull one more
                        trick than Luke and getting the win by
                        only 0,025 points. The suspense remains
                        incredibly high for the rest of the season
                        and no doubt about the fact that the
                        battle between both pilots will go back
                        and forth until the very end of the season.</p>
                    <p><strong>Vincent Tornare first rookie.</strong></p>
                    <p>Two pilots qualified from the Acro World
                        Qualifier 2022 into the Acro World Tour
                        2023, Vincent Tornare (SUI) and Maxime
                        Casamayou (FRA) both flying for Sky
                        Paragliders. Vincent managed to grab
                        8th place in that opening event of the
                        Acro World Tour pulling down high
                        quality runs and showing an impressive
                        maturity in his handling of the
                        competition. The young 20y.o Swissman
                        proved that he will be a force to be
                        reckoned with in the title fight of the
                        future.</p>
                    <p><strong>Last run drama in the battle for third.</strong></p>
                    <p>Mael Jimenez (FRA) flying the new UP
                        Misty grabbed the last spot on the
                        podium after a final run drama within
                        the top 5. Mael was fighting for that
                        podium spot with Bicho Carrera (CZE),
                        Egor Posokhin (NA) and Axel Coste (FRA).
                        Mael use a different strategy than the
                        rest of the field during the event trying to
                        use a different set of tricks and betting
                        on consistency. The final run turned out
                        to be a disaster for Egor Posokhin flying
                        his U-Turn Joker who had been able to
                        hold on to 3rd place until then but he
                        failed a trick during the last run and
                        couldn’t manage to complete is
                        routine, in the meantime Bicho Carrera
                        also didn’t manage to complete his run
                        due to the low altitude and dropped in
                        the ranking while Axel Coste while using
                        really technical tricks failed to have a
                        perfect execution. In the end Mael
                        managed to put on a clean and
                        impressive run, grabbing 2nd place on
                        that flight and 3rd overall.</p>
                    <p><strong>The fight to stay in the Acro World Tour
                            for 2024 is already real.</strong></p>
                    <p>At the end of the season 2 pilots will be
                        dropped down into the Acro World
                        Qualifier and the fight
                        to stay in there will be a tough battle as
                        nor the rookies nor the veterans want to
                        drop down into the amateur league.
                        After this first stop one pilot is already
                        sure to drop down into the AWQ. Indeed
                        Lukas Neu (GER) scored a DNS and is sure
                        to not be able to catch back the others
                        within the season. Meanwhile the fight
                        for the 10th place, the last spot to stay in
                        AWT, is already nail biting with veteran
                        Marco Papa from Italy being in the red
                        zone just 0,5p from rookie Maxime
                        Casamayou in 10th and just 1.5p from
                        Cesar Arevallo in 9th. It is clear that all
                        these pilots will want to fight teeth
                        and nail to secure their spot for the 2024
                        season as early as possible.</p>
                    <p><strong>The next stop is only a few days away</strong></p>
                    <p>On Saturday 17th June there will already
                        be the second stop of the Acro World
                        Tour with the second event over ground,
                        Kings of the Box in Allevard, France. All
                        pilots are now either in France or
                        Switzerland training for what could well
                        be a decisive moment for the title.</p>
